### Ahoy! â›µğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ I am currently working on: expanding my skills with Python and JavaScript libraries.
- ğŸŒŸ A project I'm proud of is my Overlay Updater. After creating a local Super Smash Bros. community in my home town, I needed a tool to help us manage our live streams.
- ğŸŒ± I am currently learning more functionaly Python in order to rebuild my Overlay Updater and experiment with Data Visualization.
- ğŸ¦¢ Fun fact, I learned Origami at age 5, and still practice infrequently today.
