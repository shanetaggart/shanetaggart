### Ahoy! â›µðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on expanding my skills with Python and JavaScript libraries.
- âœ¨ I am aspiring to move away from solely working on Front-End development and learn more Full Stack / Back-End development.
- ðŸŒŸ A project I'm proud of is my Overlay Updater. After creating a local Super Smash Bros. community in my home town, I needed a tool to help us manage our live streams.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning more functionaly Python in order to rebuild my Overlay Updater and experiment with Data Visualization.
- ðŸ¦¢ Fun fact! I learned Origami at age 5, and still practice infrequently today.
